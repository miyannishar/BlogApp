            orem ipsum, or lipsum as it is sometimes known, is dummy text used
            in laying out print, graphic or web designs. The passage is
            attributed to an unknown typesetter in the 15th century who is
            thought to have scrambled parts of Cicero's De Finibus Bonorum et
            asperiores repellat…” Translation by H. Rackham: “On the other hand,
            we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so
            beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so
            blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble
            that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail
            in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying
            through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly
            simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of
            choice is untrammeled and when nothing prevents our being able to do
            what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain
            avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of
            duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that
            pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise
            man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of
            selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures,
            or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.” © 2015 — 2022
